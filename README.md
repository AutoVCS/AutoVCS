# AutoVCS

AutoVCS is an application that presents summaries of individual developers' code contributions to team-based projects.  We envision that this may be particularly helpful for helping TAs and instructors grade student projects.


AutoVCS is written in Java, and can present summaries for Java code contributions tracked through GitHub (either Github.com, or Github Enterprise).  AutoVCS has the following requirements:
- Java 8+
- MySQL or MariaDB (tested with MariaDB 10.3 and MySQL 8.0)
- Our [improved version](https://github.com/AutoVCS/ChangeDistiller) of ChangeDistiller [1].


Rather than simply reporting the number of lines of code added/removed by each developer, such as Github Insights offers, AutoVCS performs program analysis on (Java) code, and by considering code syntax, can offer richer insights.  We present as an example a contributions summary produced by AutoVCS:

Details explaining I-IV are shown on the [algorithm](AutoVCS-Algorithm) page.
